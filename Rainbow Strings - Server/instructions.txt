Rainbow Server – Setup Guide
This server is for Rainbow Strings (Unity) and Rainbow Tiles (Android) games. 
It handles: 
user registration, 
login, 
progress tracking, 
and collectables using Node.js + Express + MySQL (but… not using progress tracking, and collectables).

Inside the folder “rainbow-backend” you will find two files:
schemaCreate - serves to create each table;
schemaPopulate - serves to populate database with user id/name/password ready;

Create a query in your database in client.files.io (by clicking “Web Client”) for each of the files and run it.

When setting up the server write onto the terminal cmd ‘npm install’, that will download all packages necessary.
If everything is correct, player will be able to join to the game by this link:
